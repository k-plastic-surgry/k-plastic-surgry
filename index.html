<p>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is a groundbreaking solution for patients experiencing early hair loss or thinning. This minimally invasive treatment uses the patient&rsquo;s own plasma to stimulate hair follicles, encouraging natural growth and improving hair density. PRP therapy is ideal for individuals seeking a safe and effective alternative to traditional hair restoration techniques.</p>
<p>The process involves drawing a small amount of the patient&rsquo;s blood, isolating the plasma rich in growth factors, and injecting it into targeted areas of the scalp. Over time, PRP therapy revitalizes dormant follicles, resulting in thicker, healthier hair. With a personalized treatment plan developed by Dr. Kayastha, patients can achieve transformative results that boost both their appearance and confidence.</p>
